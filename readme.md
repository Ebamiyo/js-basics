6. Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category.

    Ans: A difference between dynamically-typed programming languages and statistically -typed programming languages: Dynamically-typed languages perform type checking at runtime, examples include: JavaScript, Python, php, and Ruby. 
    Statically typed languages perform type checking at compile time, examples include Java, C, C++. This means that scripts written in dynamically-typed languages can compile even if they contain errors that will prevent the script from running properly. If a script written in a statically-typed language contains errors, it will fail to compile until the errors have been fixed.

7. Differentiate between the JavaScript data types ‘null’ and ‘undefined'.

   Ans: Null means nothing. It is the intentional absence of value of a variable. It is one of the primitive datatypes of JavaScript. Undefined: It means the value does not exist, the variable is declared but not assigned to any value including null.
